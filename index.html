                        My name is <strong>Giovanni Esposito</strong>. I’m a student at Fordham University 
                        where I study philosophy and stay heavily involved in theatre and performance. 
                        I’ve always been interested in the way ideas, stories, and people connect, and acting 
                        lets me bring those connections to life. This website is part of my HTML project, 
                        and I wanted it to reflect both my academic interests and my creative work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve performed in a variety of productions over the years — comedy, musicals, 
                        straight plays — and each role has taught me something different about timing, 
                        presence, and collaboration. When I’m not in rehearsal or class, I like exploring 
                        New York City, writing, and listening to old jazz singers.
